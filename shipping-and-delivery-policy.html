                1. Estimated Delivery Time <br>
                We strive to deliver orders within 14 days from the date of purchase. Please
                note that this is an estimated timeframe and actual delivery times may vary depending on factors such as
                shipping destination and customs processing.<br>
                2. Shipping Costs<br>
                We are pleased to offer free shipping on all orders. You won't have to worry about any additional
                shipping charges. Enjoy the convenience of browsing our products and having them delivered to your
                doorstep without any cost.<br>
                3. Order Processing Time<br>
                Once an order is placed, it will typically take 1-2 business days to process
                before shipment. During peak seasons or promotional periods, processing times may be slightly longer. We
                appreciate your patience.<br>
                4. Tracking Information<br>
                Once your order has been shipped, we will provide you with a tracking number via
                email. You can use this tracking number to monitor the progress of your shipment and estimated delivery
                date.<br>
                5. International Shipping<br>
                For international orders, please note that additional customs fees, duties, or
                taxes may apply upon arrival in the destination country. These charges are the responsibility of the
                customer and will be assessed and collected by the customs authority of the respective country.<br>
                6. Address Accuracy<br>
                It is the customer's responsibility to provide accurate and complete shipping
                information. We cannot be held responsible for delays or non-delivery of orders due to incorrect or
                incomplete address details provided by the customer.<br>
                7. Delivery Delays<br>
                While we make every effort to ensure timely delivery, unforeseen circumstances such as
                weather conditions, customs delays, or other logistical issues may occasionally result in delays beyond
                our control. We appreciate your understanding in such situations.
